## todo
renaming watchlists - not sure how to communicate this to the user with a symbol like the other options..
Investigate how sessions/caching reduces load when fetching data for multiple tickers
Implement some Mutex locks to avoid race conditions between user interaction and update thread
sanitize input/better input handling
create interface for settings + saving settings - if enough settings are found, currently only sound on/off is available and is not persistently stored
