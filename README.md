Simple and lightweight program that uses the yfinance API to pull data on tickers from Yahoo finance. More features and improved looks are planned, check the Todo!

To run the program via command-line you need: yfinance, pysimplegui

If you download and run the .exe it will update prices every 10 seconds for your tickers, this can be customized when running the program via command-line. It is not clear exactly how many calls to the yfinance API is allowed daily.
